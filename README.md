Module 1 Challenge Submission

## Overview of Project
##### To analyze how different campaigns managed their funding goals based on their launch dates and required funding amounts.

### Analysis and Challenges

###### With a combination of PIVOT tables and Charts - we were able to easily compare and contrast Outcomes of funding based on various independent variables. 

#### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Dates

###### I was able to produce the below chart off a PIVOT regarding Funding of the Theater in a monthly view. Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png. 

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

###### Using COUNTIFS Statements, we were able to group and pull the outcomes of various projects based on the amount of funding that was required to succesfully fund those said projects. In a Line Chart, you are able to easily visualize how succesful projects were based on how much funding was required.


#### Challenges

###### Some challenges that we faced revolved around the structure of the data tables. At times, we had to split up columns to make the data more applicable for our analysis. (i.e. had to split the "Category and Subcategory" Column to "parent category" and "subcategory"). Once we adjusted all these data issues, we were able to create pivots and charts rather easliy.


## Results

#### Outcomes based on Launch Dates

###### You can conclude that the mid-year months of May-August tend to be the months were most Theater projects are successfully funded. You can also conclude that more projects require funding in those months as the count the total count of projects from May to August is much higher relative to the other months.


#### Outcomes based on Goals

###### The main conclusion to draw from an analysis of the funding requirement vs a sucessfully funded project is that as the funding requirement got higher, the chances of the project failing to miss it's funding requirement increased. Projects with funding goals less than 15,000 were more often than not, succesfully funded.
