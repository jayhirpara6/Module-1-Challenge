Module 1 Challenge Submission

## Overview of Project
##### To analyze how different campaigns managed their funding goals based on their launch dates and required funding amounts.

### Analysis and Challenges

###### With a combination of PIVOT tables and Charts - we were able to easily compare and contrast Outcomes of funding based on various independent variables. 

#### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Dates
##### I was able to produce the below chart off a PIVOT regarding Funding of the Theater in a monthly view. Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png. Here you can see that funding was more successful in the early parts of every year, specifically in May and June.

#### Challenges

###### Some challenges that we faced revolved around the structure of the data tables. At times, we had to split up columns to make the data more applicable for our analysis. (i.e. had to split the "Category and Subcategory" Column to "parent category" and "subcategory"). Once we adjusted all these data issues, we were able to create pivots and charts rather easliy.
